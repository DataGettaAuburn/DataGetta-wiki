# Welcome to the datagetta wiki

This wiki will eventually contain a full library of documentation for all aspects of the project.

See table of contents for setup help, and troubleshooting tips as well.

## Contributing to the Wiki

As we continue to make changes, it is imperative that we are continuously creating thorough documentation. Given the continuous nature of this project, the more thorough we are at documenting the project, the easier the turnover and improvement becomes. At the time that we inherited this project, lack of thorough documentation was by far the biggest problem that wasted a lot of time in the early stages.

See below for simple instructions on how to begin adding your documentation to the Wiki.

### Notes Before Getting Started

The GitHub Wiki feature is a super intuitive way of organizing Markdown (`.md`) files in a user friendly manner. You can go about editing these pages either locally, by cloning the wiki scoped repository, or by editing directly in GitHub's web browser. For more info, you can checkout GitHub's Wiki docs [here](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/documenting-your-project-with-wikis/about-wikis).

### 1. Creating a New Page

The first step in this process is super straight forward- you need to create a new page for your topic. This is genuinely as easy as clicking the `New Page` button at the top of the screen. If for whatever reason you have no idea what is meant by this, just click [here](https://github.com/tyler-teufel/datagetta/wiki/_new).

Once the new page is created, you will be redirected to a page to edit the markdown directly in the browser. This can be super helpful especially if you are new to markdown, as it shows you a preview in GitHub's flavor of markdown, and gives you tools for adding in styling.

### 2. Adding the Page to the Table of Contents

Our table of contents lives in an organized manner in the sidebar you see on the wiki interface. This sidebar is simply just another markdown component, that we have organized simply using the header hierarchies. Once you have created and completed your document, you will want to add a link to your markdown file that now exists in the repository under whatever specific section your document falls to. If you feel that it does not fit a relevant category, but is too important to be considered miscellaneous, please feel free to add in a new header.

For those of you who are still learning markdown, adding in links is super straightforward. Use the following code block as a reference:

```markdown
For links to other sites:

[Link Text](https://link-to-website)

And for links to other headers:

[Link Text](hyphen-spaced-header-text)

```

### 3. Update as needed

One of the most important aspects of documentation creation is ensuring they're constantly maintained and updated. It never hurts to have a second set of eyes laid on it, and your docs are only as helpful as they are up to date!
